Proper 404 page
 - add roles 'authenticated' and 'unauthenticated' so they can be managed by checkPermissions (not sure if I should do this)

User
  - change user routes to /user/x, /user/x/edit, /user/x/cancel DONE

NOTES:
Default Config object in bootstrap
 - resourcePermissonList contains the list of resources and also the permissions that may be granted to access those resources.  Each time a new resource is created, this list needs to be updated
 - rolesPermissionGrant contains the list of roles and the permissions granted to each role on each resource.  Anytime a new role is created, this list needs to be updated
 
Closures in middleware validation - There is a very subtle issue when closures are used in the middleware validation 
for routes.  Basically, the outer function gets run once (at start up) and any variables within the scope of the 
outer function are set at that time and will not change as long as the server runs.  The only variables that can
change are those modified by the inner function.  In the example below, once the server starts, the value of a is set
and can never change.

app.get('/route1', runEachTime(someVar), function(req, res){})
function runEachTime(aVar){
  var a = aVar
  return function inner(req, res, next){
    doSomethingWithA(a)
  }
}
